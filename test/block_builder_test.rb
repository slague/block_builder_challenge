# Design a command-line controller program for a robotic arm that takes commands that move blocks stacked in a series of slots. After each command, output the state of the slots, which each line of output corresponding to a slot and each X corresponding to a block.
#
# Commands:
#
# size [n] - Adjusts the number of slots, resizing if necessary. Program must start with this to be valid.
# add [slot] - Adds a block to the specified slot.
# mv [slot1] [slot2] - Moves a block from slot1 to slot2.
# rm [slot] - Removes a block from the slot.
# replay [n] - Replays the last n commands.
# undo [n] - Undo the last n commands.
# Your program should validate that the commands are syntactically valid before executing them.
