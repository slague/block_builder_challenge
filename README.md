## Overview

The BlockBuilder is a command-line controller program for a robotic arm that takes commands that move blocks (a block is represented by an X) stacked in a series of slots. After each command, the state of the slots is printed to the terminal.  

### Commands:

 size [n] - Adjusts the number of slots, resizing if necessary. When the arm is re-sized, blocks remain in place. However, if an arm is resized to a smaller size, blocks in the truncated space(s) are lost.
 add [slot] - Adds a block to the specified slot.
 mv [slot1] [slot2] - Moves a block from slot1 to slot2.
 rm [slot] - Removes a block from the slot.
 replay [n] - Replays the last n commands.
 undo [n] - Undo the last n commands.


### Testing

This app uses minitest for testing. To run the tests comment out the lines of code outside of the BlockBuilder class in lib/block_builder.rb (This is everything below the comment line.) Then run `ruby test/block_builder_test.rb`
